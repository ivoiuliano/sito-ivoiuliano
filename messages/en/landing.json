Since 1999 I have been interested in the viola da gamba and also in the historical settings of instruments of the violin family. The last years I have been working mostly on instruments in modern setting, using my knowledge from my earlier experience working on ancient instruments. I work in Rovereto, Trento (Italy)."

Luckily, this summer I came across an instrument made by Ivo Iuliano in 2024. It is a deep-, healthy-sounding and richly nuanced violin that performs excellently and with great balance across all registers. I keep discovering new qualities in the instrument, and I feel it offers endless possibilities in terms of color and expression. It has become my trusted instrument, one that carries beautifully in any concert hall.",
