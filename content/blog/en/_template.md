Write the article content in **Markdown** (English) here.

- Lists
- **Bold**
- *Italic*
- [Link](https://example.com)

## Subheading

You can use headings, paragraphs and images. To add an image, put it in `public/images/blog/` and write:

![Image description](/images/blog/filename.webp)

Save this file with a unique name (e.g. `how-i-build-a-violin.md`). The filename (without .md) becomes the article URL: `/blog/filename`. For the Italian version create the same file in `content/blog/it/` with translated content.
