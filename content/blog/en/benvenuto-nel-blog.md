Welcome to the **blog** section of my site.

I am **Ivo Iuliano**, a luthier based in Rovereto. Here you will find news from the workshop, thoughts on lutherie, string instruments, and the making of violins, violas, cellos and baroque instruments.

I share work in progress, choices of materials and setup, and stories behind the instruments that leave my workshop. If you are interested in the world of lutherie or are looking for a new instrument or restoration work, I hope these pages will be useful to you.

Feel free to explore the rest of the site to learn about the **services** I offer and how to **get in touch**. I will be glad to answer your questions.
